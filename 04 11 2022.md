# Weekly Summary of April 11 to April 15

## Key points:
- Performed Refresher training for Olga at Alkermes on her VIPS unit with Isaac and Gautier
  - This allowed Isaac and Gautier to see the VIPS in action for the first time and allow Olga the opportunity to record the training process for future reference.
- Met with Thomas in Norwood to review the process for commissioning the ICON leading up to the AGC installation.
  - Still some potential bugs in the software surrounding the viability quantification.
  - commissioning protocol provided by the team in the UK was quite sub-par and very confusing to follow
    - Raised a case in Salesforce to push for revisions of this protocol by UK team to enable the engineers to properly commission the ICON
- Had call with Kirill Tarsov of the NIH to discuss the next steps for moving forward with experimental demonstration for his labs needs.
