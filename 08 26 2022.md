# Weekly Summary of August 22 to August 26

## Key points:
- Supported Avi remotely as she performed a mechanical assessment of the AGC's ICON in support of [case 00049130](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000HgE3NAAV/view)
  - Avio initially had trouble getting a response from the UK as to how to put the instrument into comissioning mode as she never attempted this in the field before.  She didn't receive a response right away and i sugested to her that she de-install the customer version of the software and re-install the commissioning version as this was the fix we performed at the Dynamicure Demonstration weeks back.
  - It was discovered that the neutral density filter was not properly aligned and was in between position 2 and position 3
    - **Ingrid provided a protocol for Avi to re-align the filters should she need to utilizing the onboard LED to align the filters.  This clashed with the way Avi was taught to commission the instrument in Wimborne but ultimately proved to be more effect and a better method to perform the task**
  - The exposure time was also set to 1 ms and not 1000 ms which could also explain the high standard deviation of the customers samples
  - **Avi experienced a issue regarding the commissioning of the instrument (her commissioning tool kept crashing version 1.0.6 ).  she spent the better part of two hours trying to receive help from the UK to no avail.  After a few email exchanges with the Service team in the US we were able to get her connected with George Bishop who was able to provide initial software support.
- Had remote session with Emma to support the team at Wheeler for [case 00048994](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000HfypxAAB/view)
  - The team is still experiencing identical issues similar to AGC.
  - Emma and i determined that the route cause is not related to the teams pipetting and is related to the instrument
  - The next step would be to have service go onsite and apply the same trouble shooting methods that were performed at AGC
- Sat in with Isaac on a call with [Cellaria](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4oqWAAR/view) to discuss the revival of a VIPS demonstration
  - we attempted to demo for them in the past but they couldn't provide clear details regarding their budget situation and we ultimately scrapped the demo
  - The call this week consisted of Dima (lab scientist) and David Deems (CEO)
  - The company is in the process of closing another round of funding and Isaac is going to set up a conditional PO instead of traditional demo to which the customer seemed excited about.
- Sat in with Nana and the team from [NIH](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000D7ercAAB/view) to finalize the VIPS seeding demonstration of their Cardiomyocyte populations.
  - Demo finalized for the week of September 19th
  - exploring HEK seeding in addition to the cardiomyocytes
