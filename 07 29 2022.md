# Weekly Summary of July 25 to July 29

## Key points:
- Planned demonstration of the VIPS for [Astra Zeneca Opportunity](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000Fm9ACAAZ/view)
  - this demo is purely experimental.  The prospect wants to seed into her Corning 4588 plates (Non- TC treated and Not validated by our R&D team in the UK)
  - The prospect has pretty strict metrics that she is hoping to hit (no more than 8% of the wells can be over seeded, outgrowth must be above 30% per single seeded well)
  - This demo is on the higher risk side as there are quite a few variables outside our control (Plates, over seeding expectations outgrowth %).
- Presented the demonstration results to the scientific team at Genentech.
  - overall everything went smoothly.
  - Joni from Genentech curated her own presentation based on the raw data we provided her.  She misinterpreted the results and informed us that she observed a higher rate of false negatives.
  - I prepared a complete breakdown of all the false negatives observed (all were due to poor droplet placement in certain wells) and plan to review the data Joni a second time
- Met with the scientific team at UCB to discuss their upcoming [VIPS training](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/WorkOrder/0WO4x000001qFVxGAM/view)
  - Team was awaiting for the build out of their new lab space to accommodate the instrument
  - their priorities have shifted slightly and they don't plan to use the instrument right away.
- Sent VOC requests to the following accounts in Bryant's territory:
  - [Shattuck Labs](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbcxRAAQ/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FReport%2F00O4x000004YfofEAC%2Fview%3FqueryScope%3DuserFolders)
  - [Lacerta](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbcmaAAA/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FReport%2F00O4x000004YfofEAC%2Fview%3FqueryScope%3DuserFolders)
