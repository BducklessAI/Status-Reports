# Weekly Summary of March 21 to March 25

## Key points:
- Performed a live VIPS demonstration for the board of directors at AI office
  - This provided context of the Solentim portion of the overall R&D roadmap for 2022.
- Collaborated with Hassan to produce a Demo Coordination SOP for the Service team.
  - This will be developed to an automated scheduling system in Salesforce to aid in a more efficient scheduling process for the Solentim product portfolio.
- Performed first STUDIUS Demo using the new Virtual Machine To Millipore in St. Louis
  - Moving forward, this will allow us to showcase the power of STUDIUS without running wet Demos
- Wrapped up Vertex iPSC Demo
  - The demo went very well but will serve as an example to ensure that the lab we are demoing for is in complete agreement with the methods we provide to ensure the success of the demo.  The PI at vertex really didn't pay too much attention to the matriclone adaptation or the feeding schedule and as a results had sub par cells to use for our demo.
