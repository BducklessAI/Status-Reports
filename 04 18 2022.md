# Weekly Summary of April 18 to April 22

## Key points:
- Onsite at AGC for the Installation and Applications training for their ICON unit
  - Installation couldn't be completed.  It was decided to send the instrument back to Norwood for repairs.
  - Return trip to Seattle is pending the repairs in Norwood next week.
    - Identified major pinch points in the installation and Quality processes and relayed them to the team in [Case 00047356](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000FAVp1AAH/view)
- Opened [Case 00047401](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000FAnu3AAD/view) for John at Alector.
  - Issue at hand indicate that John or a member of his team tried to copy over old data file into an existing batch after mistakenly scanning into another batch created a meta data BATCHID file duplicate.  This would indicate a slight form of data manipulation took place and although it can be fixed I advised that John and his team be more cognizant of which batches they are scanning into.
