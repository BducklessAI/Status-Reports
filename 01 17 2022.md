# Weekly Summary of January 17 to January 21

## All FAS activity can be tracked on [FAS SalesForce](https://solentim.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home)

## Key points:
- Met with Mark and Camilla to discuss proceeding with media testing across the various plate types.
  - This project will be slated as a summer intern project in the UK
  - Will reconvene at SLAS to discuss how to progress.
  - End goal is to generate a one sheet to be distributed to prospects and existing customers.
- Assisted with the Installation at SparX Therapeutics.
  - Observed interesting new details regarding how to install the unit given the cabinet the customer has (SparX has an older model Thermo Fisher 1300 Series A2 that has limited sash movement which forced us to load the instrument front side first rather than the preferred way of angling the instrument with the backside facing out)
  - Also observed how things go wrong when the instrument is shipped improperly:
    - **A non Solentim Screw was found on the back panel of the crate where we typically only use nails.-> This was pointed out by Thomas**
    - **The crate was also damaged on arrival causing Thomas to make many micro adjustments to the instrument caused by jostling during shipment.**
  - **User training needs to be limited to the main end user and 1 other person**
    - **The training got way out of hand with multiple individuals rotating in and out asking the same set of questions disrupting the flow of the session.**
    - **Need to include more than two nozzles in the starter kit-> the scientists dropped the nozzles multiple times while trying to manipulate the piece.  Might be worth including at least 5 to start incase of accidents like this**
    - **Lack of initial presale technical discussions lead to a lot of onsite guess work and miscommunications.  They bought this unit without an evaluation which normally includes communications  regarding their current workflow, plates being used, media being used cells being used, overall scope of their work and what is need from us.**
    - **Many questions came up during the training regarding specific criteria need for submissions with the FDA-> I deferred on these questions and told them that they need to discuss this concerns with their regulatory team.**
- Started organizing the procurement and storage of ICON IgG standard in Norwood.
  - Coordinated with Tom, Chris and Meredith at Norwood to establish Purchasing, storing and distribution cadence moving forward.
- Finalized the VIPS Evaluation design for Cellaria to review.
  - Sent the proposal to Dima and his team to approve and determine evaluation dates.
