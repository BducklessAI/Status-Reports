# Weekly Summary of May 02 to May 06

## Key points:
- Created [Experimental Design Templates](https://aicompanies.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SolentimAppsTeam/ElUWq8OZUYdJsDpSmnRaVzUBpsgdIUkeR6E1L2HJ4ZVtYg?e=OD3okv) for the applications team
  - These new documents have the corrected AI logos and Company information to avoid confusion with legacy Solentim information.
  - These will provided a more streamlined approach to planning wet demonstrations at customer sites.
- Attended virtual iPSC demo conducted by Emma for [Cytovia](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4obqAAB/view)
  - Picked up a few tricks regarding how to conduct virtual demos that should make the stateside process easier.
  - Emma did not actually show any live seeding but rather just described the actions of the instrument and walked through an existing data set.
- Further qualified [Deka Biosciences Cell Metric](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000DsEfoAAF/view) Opportunity with Nana
  - Needed to further justify the need for them to demo a cell metric which historically we have never done.
  - The information on this opportunity is sparse so Nana and I needed to dig deeper and qualify the prospect for her to determine if a demo is worth it to secure the sale.
  - Met with Hassan, Reza and Christine to discuss planning on capturing VOCs for the Cell Line Development products
    - Currently we do not have any in house VOCs that we can utilize during the sales process to further back our claims regarding IND submissions using the VIPS or Cell Metric.
    - Plan is to zero in on the instruments that have been installed and used for at least three years to gauge if they used the cell metric reports in any INDs.
- Aided Lei Chen form Sanofi Pasteur-Toronto work through his issues with [case 00047676](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000FRO7BAAX/view)
