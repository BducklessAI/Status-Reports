# Weekly Summary of June 20 to June 24

## Key points:
- Conducted a trouble shooting sessions for Alkermes [case 00048432](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000HdVDmAAN/view)
  - Main issue is that the PI was seeing a plate scan/focusing Error when she attempted to scan a plate on her cell metric using profiles that have worked historically.
  - **The PI noted that things starting taking a turn once Thomas performed a PM on their VIPS**
  - **IT may have changed permissions on both the VIPS and Cell Metric CLD leading to downstream read/write issues in the software**
  - Conferred with both Ross and Deren as to how to approach the issue.  Deren wants to rule out any hardware or plate faults before turning attention to any software faults.
  - A follow up with the PI is slated for Monday June 27th.
- Conducted meet and great for the scientific team at Zoetis prior to their cell metric training next week
  - Reviewed the expectations/ and goals of the training and fielded general questions posed by the team.
- Supplemented down time by watching a [Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLu3NazBbLw) conducted by Michael Watkins at MIT Sloan Business School and a [Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyTQ5-SQYTo) conducted by Simon Sinek at the Live2Lead conference
- Met with onsite with the Cytovia team to perform a quick check of their iPSC cells leading up to their Demo on July 7th.
  - Checked the progress of the matriclone adaptation/ overall cell health.
