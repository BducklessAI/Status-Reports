# Weekly Summary of July 18 to July 22

## Key points:
- completed false negative analysis for the Genentech data set based on comments from last weeks strategy meeting.
  - The PI at Genentech is very keen on having this piece of data in her decision making.
- Worked with Nana an service team to set up an site demonstration at [Astra Zeneca](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000Fm9ACAAZ/view)
  - Opportunity is for a VIPS for CHO seeding with Fluorescence into 384 well plates.
  - Customer has previously demoed 3 other instruments this year with very poor outgrowth.
  - great position for AI to show of the capabilities of the VIPS.
- Presented data to [Dynamicure](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4oWtAAJ/view) for their ICON demonstration with Isaac and Christine.
  - The team already has the Cell metric CLD in their quiver and adding the ICON will be a great addition in their process
  - potential plan in  the budget for next year for the VIPS should they continue to be unhappy with their Sphere Fluidics Cytomine instrument.
- Provided support for Cases at [Wheeler](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000HfypxAAB/view) and [AGC](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000HgE3NAAV/view) regarding their continued troubles generating reliable standard curves on their ICON instrument.
  - Both labs are having issues generating curves without high levels of variation between the replicates which is causing poor interpolation of their unknown samples
  - Emma and I have been actively troubleshooting to see what is inherently different with these two systems compared to the functioning units in Norwood, Wimborne and Genmab.
  - we have instructed the labs to run curves again using just our Sigma IgG and their base media and current plates.  If the problem persists than Borys and myself may need to perform site visits to rule out if it's a system or procedural issue.
