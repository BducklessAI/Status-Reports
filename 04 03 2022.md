# Weekly Summary of April 04 to April 08

## Key points:
- Onsite at [EverCell Bio](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbch1AAA/view) for a VIPS refresher
  - Establishing relationships with the scientists on site.
  - Customer is a big fan of the VIPS that could potentially be used for VOCs
  - Discovered that they are missing a key piece of software for their iPSC work which resulted in a new quote for the iPSC confluence module on Cell Metric.
  - Introduce the scientist to Theresa for his future Matriclone needs (potential standing order)
- Performed a virtual demo for [WuXi Biologics](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbcfDAAQ/view) for their new Cell Metric CLD (Took about 3 hours to complete end to end)
  - Did this without teamviewer which tested my knowledge of the software-> The team was quite happy with the results of the training
    - Session also resulted in them asking for a quote for additional cassettes for their CLD (10 total)
    - Tony, the PI, mentioned his current struggle with current methods single cell cloning which opened up the conversation regarding the Insti range of products -> put him in touch with Theresa for further information regarding the product line
- Met virtually with John from [Alector, LLC](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000h7qPFAAY/view) for another round of VIPS trouble shooting
  - Further strengthening the relationship with this lab
  - Everything turned out fine, their Nozzle needed a little extra cleaning to reduce the instances of satellite drops present during deposition.
- Created and SOP for swapping out the Magnetic Bar present on the Cell Reservoir.
  - This will be need for all reservoirs that are earmarked for DEMOS and will provide the Applications team the knowledge to preform this task when needed.
