# Weekly Summary of March 07 to March 11

## Key points:
- Onsite for a follow up with Karin at Sanofi to further troubleshoot focusing issues for [case 00046553](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000DbjJQAAZ/view)
  - Determined that the issue stemmed from sub-par quality BD Falcon 96 Well plates (Most likely a result of poor quality plastics)
  - Confirmed this by performing a side by side comparison of our plates supplied by the UK team.
- Onsite at Vertex for VIPS iPSC Demo.
  - Quite a few pain points with this demo but ultimately Emma, Thomas and I were able to push through it and deliver a quality demonstration
  for Manoj and his team who were very impressed with the instrument's capabilities. (issues related to improper communication about magnet bar sizes for the Demo units.  Emma and I ironed out the issues with the UK team)
