  - First attempt for me performing a remote demonstration for the CLD
  - Performed the demonstration using their current Wolf seeded.  The instrument took almost 1 hour and 45 minutes to set up and prime.
  - Stephanie from Deka reached out to Nana for VIPS quotes.
- Onsite at AGC for their [ICON applications training](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/WorkOrder/0WO4x000001qiy2GAA/view)
  - Training went quite smoothly! Kayla and her team are very happy with the product!
  - Spent time optimizing their molecules for low/high standards and used this a hands on practice for their team as they well have to generate these for each new molecule they need to test.
- Met with Isaac and the scientific team from Dynmaicure to discuss their ICON [Opportunity](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4oWtAAJ/view)
