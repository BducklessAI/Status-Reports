# Weekly Summary of August 29 to September 02

## Key points:

- Miscellaneous work:
  - Compiled working results deck for exploratory VIPS demos
    - Astra Zeneca
    - NIH
    - University of Miami
- [Lonza, Rockville, MD](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x000014e3SSAAY/view) VIPS Pro (Follow-up meeting)
  - Main purpose was to sterility concerns that the scientific team has regarding the VIPS pro in a GMP environment
- [Wheeler Bio, Oklahoma City, OK](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbcgOAAQ/view), ICON (Remote Troubleshooting)
  - Remote session with Sam Story, Chris Warren and Aviance McKenzie.
  - Chris and Sam made adjustments to Exposure setting in the STUDIUS database to allow the customer to successfully run a standard curve
- [Takeda, Cambridge MA](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbdNmAAI/view) InstigroHEK (Meeting)
  - Met with Andrea and Theresa with Gilles Michel form Takeda to discuss efforts to troubleshoot poor recovery using InstigroHEK.
  - Customer will attempt to try using new media formulated for single cell cloning of HEK293 suspension cells
- [Atellas, Westboro, MA](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000FmPwCAAV/view) VIPS Pro (Meeting/introductory Call)
  - Goal of meeting is to discuss new products under NDA
  - Main scope of the team is to generate iPSC derived NK cells
  - Currently using i-matrix 511 for plate coating
  - Team is working closely with Universal Cells in Seattle.
  - Interested in mainly iPSC cloning but want an instrument with the flexibility to perform seeding of other cell types.
  - Universal Cells are currently scanning Embryoid Bodies utilizing AggreWell plates form StemCell.
  - Interested in demoing the VIPS PRO
- [NIH, Rockville, MD](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000GTKi8AAH/view) VIPS (Introductory Meeting)
  - Cheng Ling-> Works in core facility focusing on generating cell lines from multiple immortalized cell lines (mostly for internal use)
  - Looking for a single cell seeder (hasn't demoed or looked into any additional instruments at the time of the call).
  - Currently performing single cell cloning utilizing Limiting Dilution and observing cell deposition by eye using bright field microscopy on Day 0
  - Not performing any additional scans beyond the day of seeding.
  - **Customer responded with the instrument price is out of his budget range**
- NIH, Rockville, MD Matriclone (Introductory Meeting)
  - Aided on a call with Theresa and Andrea with an iPSC lab at the NIH (utilizing CRISPR knock in/out transfection)
  - Team currently is performing colony passaging at a low density and selecting colonies assuming clonality
  - team is using Revitacell and stemflex for seeding and cloning
  - team has yet to attempt single cell seeding at 96 or 384 well plates with the assumption that the cells wont survive at the single cell level.
  - Theresa to send sample to the team and I will assist in the experimental design.
