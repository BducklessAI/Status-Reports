# Weekly Summary of August 01 to August 05

## Key points:
- Met with Isaac and Olga from Alkermes regarding an [opportunity](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000CmsLEAAZ/view) for a Fluorescent VIPS
  - Currently having issues with visualizing cells on Day 0 in the whole well image and doesn't want to wait until day 14 to see colony growth then track back. She wants to have the known single cell number on day zero
  - wants to stain with Cell tracker Red or Green to confirm the presence of single cells in the whole well.
  - commented on the speed of the seeding being too slow however she has enjoyed using the system for her current validation projects.
  - Seeking either a VIPS or Cell Metric CLD with the Fluorescent filters.
  - Planning on Moving forward with an FL VIPS demo with Cell tracker stained cells for Mid to late September.
- Discussed the next steps internally for the Genentech opportunity.
  - All signs are pointing to demo the VIPS Pro and potentially Cell Metric X when available
  - Automation integration is looking to play a big factor in this opportunity.  How can we adapt it for Genentech's purposes?
  - First pass would be to have Emma perform a live seed run of the instrument to the folks at Genentech
- Reviewed updated slides provide by Paul for future lunch and learns and product discussions and practice timing and slide presentation
  - Previous attempt at presenting "Frankenstein deck" internally went pretty poorly in my opinion
  - deck was too detail oriented and my timing was awful-> didn't even finish the presentation in the 1 hour allotted time
- Met the scientific team at Lonza regarding their [VIPS iPSC opportunity](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4oWCAAZ/view)
  - The team is moving forward with purchasing the instrument
  - Potential to transfer the instrument tot he Houston site down the road.
  - **Nana to discuss VIPS PRO with the team.  the instrument has the chance to move to Lonza's GMP facility in Houston**
- Met with Emily in Norwood to review procedures for conducting a remote demonstration from the media.  Also covered how to create snippets using the iPad.
- Aided the folks at Alector with troubleshooting their VIPS
  - important to keep this account happy as they have been quite unhappy with our service in the past.
  - Everything worked out just fine!  The scientist just need a little confidence and re assurance that what they were doing was correct and proper.
  - performed quick VOC with Sabrina while I had her on the line!
    - Overall they are pleased with the switch to the V2 nozzle from the V1.  
    - No complaints with service or anything else regarding the instrument
- Started to compile an FAQ/best practices for the ICON
  - Modeled after ValitaCell's titer [FAQ page](https://valitacell.com/faq/) which is top notch!
  - Distributed to the global applications team for further input and revisions
- Met with Emma and Christine as well as the scientific team from AGC to review the ongoing issues with their ICON [Case 00049130](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000HgE3NAAV/view).
  - Plan for next week is to send Borys from Service to ensure that the instrument is in working order and everything check outs from a mechanical standpoint
  - Emma conducted another session to review proper technique for plate preparation and generating standard curves.
  - Kayla retried running human IgG samples using Emma's technique and the results had high standard deviations were present though they were lower than previously tested.
  - **It is now believed that this is sample handling issue.**
