# Weekly Summary of January 31 to February 4

## Key points:
- Met with Emma, Rosario to debrief on the [City of Hope](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4odfAAB/view) VIPS Opportunity
  - Biggest concern currently is their budget-> They mentioned they will not have secure funding until after the instrument has been demoed at their site at which time they will apply internally for the funds.
  - The most likely work around for this would be to charge them for the demo and deduct the cost from their purchase price(roughly $10,000)
  - Rosario to further qualify the prospect.
- Engaged with the sales team for the North America Sales meeting
- Engaged with Genevieve and Deren for 4 hours via team viewer to discuss [Case 00036326](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000CcpBfAAJ/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F0014x00000sbdPzAAI%2Fview)
