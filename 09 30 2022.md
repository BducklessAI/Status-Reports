# Weekly Summary of September 26 to September 30

## Key points:
- [Evotec](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbcxFAAQ/view), Gottengien VIPS (Trouble shooting meeting):
  - Met with European Applications and Service teams along with the scientific teams at Evotec to tray and pinpoint their issues related to iPSC outgrowth.  Call Notes:
  - IT/ wash station issues resolved
  - PM is upcoming on CLD
  - 7 runs with the VIPS resulted in dead cells
    - Most recent run resulted in live cells that propagated
  - Differences between their technique and Emma's demo technique was that Emma incubated the cell in accutase a little longer than they typically do
    - Their specific time wasn’t mentioned.
  - Recent efforts with extended washing seemed to be helpful in a seeding run that produced viable cells
  - Our main theory is that some cleaning solution is still present either in the cell reservoir/nozzle or the media line causing cell death.  
    - Cell health leading up to the sort is great-> 95% viability or higher
  - LD and serial dilution plates grew just fine.
  - Their current media formulation produces very splashy drops
    - Moved away from mTeSR media and switch to iPSC- Brew for GMP concerns
    - Are also in the process of testing E8 media
    - Emma fears it is not a rich media to support single clones
    - Team feels that their cells are happier in IPS-Brew
  - First Two rows of seeding resulted in dead cells but after well B12, wells showed signs of outgrowth
    - Potentially a sign that the harsh cleaning solutions were diluted out.
    - Team at Evotec only tried seeding one plate
  - Team will attempt to utilize the wash station to flush the nozzles and reservoir with media
  - Evotec team plans a follow up experiment seeding 10+ plates
  - LD and serial dilutions plates will be run in parallel
 - Plates are cultured on 6 well plates coated with 0.25ug/cm2  
 - No plans to increase the concentration as things are working well at the moment.
 - Team is still utilizing the cell line that they developed for the demo that Emma conducted.
  - Philip's team will eventually sequence the clones that will eventually outgrow
  - Evotec team will run the small experiments and report back to the Advanced Instruments team to determine if it was a success or failure
  ○ FAS/FSE will be dispatched should Evotec need it


- [Astra Zeneca](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000sbdMbAAI/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FOpportunity%2F0064x00000Fm9ACAAZ%2Fview), Gaithersburg, MD VIPS PRO/STUDIUS (follow-up meeting):
  - Astra Zeneca's concerns are exporting data in non-proprietary format.
    - Need raw images for FDA filing
    - Project Cycles outlive the lifespan of the instruments
    - Need free access to all raw data and meta data
  - Data format needs to be sensible and human readable
  - Thomas has never stored images in a SQL data base before
  - Will studius exist in 10 years??
  - Astra Zeneca needs access to TIF files indefinitely
  - SQL database backups are in the timeline at AI for next year at the earliest
  - **Team will most likely not Purchase the instrument this year**


- [NIH Biomedical Research Center](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Demo__c/a3l4x000001qYdYAAU/view), Baltimore, MD VIPS (On-site Demo)
  - On-site demo to attempt to seed primary cardiomyocytes isolated directly from mouse and rabbit cardiac tissue and a human lung epithelial cell line
  - **We were able to successfully seed the customers cells and confirm that their buffers are compatible with the VIPS**
  - The Scientific team will discuss the results internally and report back to Nana with their decision.
