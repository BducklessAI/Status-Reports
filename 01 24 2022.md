## Key points:
- Met with the Type diabetes team from [Vertex](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000CWNrHAAX/view) with Jake, and Emma to discuss options for iPSC seeding.
  - The team is looking to ease away from manual processes and incorporate new imaging methods.
  - Seemed **very** keen on the GMP grade materials available for the unit.
  - Aiming for a technical demonstration the first week of March at their Seaport location.
  - Jake to send their team MatriClone information to allow them to adapt their cells to our soluble laminin product.
  - **Demo Moduale is not present On AI Salesforce.  How are we going to track the Demo/outcomes?**
- Engaged with Lei Chen from [Sanofi Pasteur](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000n6VXJAA2/view) with technical questions regarding his VIPS/Cell Metric training.
  - Raised concerns regarding if his hood would be able to house the instrument-> his [BioKlone2](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4830653/bioklone-2-series-class-ii-type-a2-biological-safety-cabinets-microzone) is within spec.
  - The VIPS manual states the instrument will fit in a "Standard" biosafety cabinet which is quite vague since multiple types are on the market.
Met with Paul, Emily and Hassan to discuss the approach of presenting the demonstration process to the sales team
  - Emily to cover Osmo products, I will cover the Solentim Products
- Met with Emma, George, Hassan for the Bi-Weekly FAS meeting

- Met with the FAS Team to discuss general updates
  - George H. Talked about how to link functions in Outlook to sales force.

- Engaged with Genevieve from Ology regarding her current issue with focusing on her Cell metric CLD
  - [Case 00036326](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5004x00000CcpBfAAJ/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F0014x00000sbdPzAAI%2Fview)
  - Customer is quite difficult and demanding.
  - Thomas will be on site to ensure the hardware is up to spec and is not causing the issues she's experiencing.
  - Will set up additional sessions with Genevieve next week to help her sort out any errors that are application based (See Notes in the case file for description of what's to be performed.)
- Engaged with Sungtae of GSK to rectify miscommunication regarding training on the cell metric.
  - Additional training was accidentally promised to the customer that was not purchased.
  - I'm Proposing to fill the gaps virtually.
  - **Training descriptions in price book line items are very vague and need to be adjusted**
  - KAMs need to be clear with the customer as to what is included in the training.
- Engaged with Sarah from Seattle Genetics with Paul M. regarding her [VIPS Opportunity](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4obKAAR/view).
  - Not interested in the VIPS currently since it's not compatible with seeding plates that are coated.
  - discussed the possibility of incorporating the ICON into the workflow
    - Not interested since they are currently utilizing the Octet for productivity testing.
- Engaged with Rosario on two Opportunities: [City of Hope](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0064x00000C4odfAAB/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F0014x00000sbcrFAAQ%2Fview) and [BlueNalu](https://advancedinstruments.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0014x00000h7qPAAAY/view)
  - City of Hope would be a great opp for the VIPS iPSC path and BlueNalu offers and interesting direction into the seafood aquaculture market.
  - City of Hope opportunity will present challenges when it comes to purchasing the instrument-> Currently no funding is set and the earliest they can purchase would be Q3 of this year should the funding be apporved.
